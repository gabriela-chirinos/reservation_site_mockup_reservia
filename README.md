[RESERVATION SITE](./gif.gif)

This project is a **reservation site mockup**, one of my first web development projects. It serves as a practice project for structuring a basic **booking or reservation website** using **HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript**. The project includes a navigation menu, a search section, and multiple reservation cards showcasing different options.

## 🚀 Features

- **Simple, clean layout** with easy navigation

- **Search functionality** to find locations

- **Card-based design** for showcasing reservation options

- **CSS styling with Bootstrap influence**


## 🎯 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structuring content

- **CSS3** for styling and layout improvements

- **Bootstrap (early usage)** for layout assistance

- **JavaScript** (optional future improvements)

## 📌 Improvements & Insights

### What Can Be Improved:

1. **Proper Alignment**:

   - The search button near the header is misaligned. The layout has been adjusted in the updated CSS.

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**:

   - The original version was not mobile-friendly. Adding **CSS media queries** would ensure it looks great on all screen sizes.

3. **Interactive Features**:

   - Could include a **date picker** and user authentication for an enhanced booking experience.

### Lessons Learned:

- Gained **early experience with HTML & CSS layouts**.

- Practiced using **navigation bars and card structures**.

- Learned the importance of **proper alignment and spacing** for UI consistency.
